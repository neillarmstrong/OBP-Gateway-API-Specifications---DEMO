== Overview
Optiva's API gateway enables integrators to leverage the power of Optiva's BSS and Customer Management solutions with third-party applications.

Optiva's API gateway has the three following API Specifications:

* *cmsapigw-swagger -* Optiva's Customer Management API, which includes a series of requests that allow third-party applications to offer the functionality of Optiva's Customer Management Portal. 

* *obp-rtr-apigw -* Optiva's BSS API (REST to REST), which includes a series of requests to interact with Optiva's BSS.   

* *obp-rts-apigw -* Optiva's BSS API (REST to SOAP), which includes a series of requests to interact with Optiva's BSS. 

Optiva's API leverages endpoints that are goal-oriented and that can be used either individually or as part of a more complex workflow.

*Note:* Optiva's API specifications are hollistic and include both requests that can be integrated against by third parties as well as requests that are only for Optiva's use.

== Getting Started

Optiva's API gateway uses Keycloak for authentication of requests.

=== Introduction to Keycloak

https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] is used to provide the identity management module for secure access between applications within OBP.

Keycloak provides Single Sign-On (SSO) capability, Identity Brokering, User Federation, and Authorization Services. Keycloak supports external IDPs such as LDAP or ADP via User Federation and SSO redirect for OIDC & SAML logins via Identity Brokering.

A Keycloak instance is deployed into the *Infra* cluster as part of the OBP deployment pipeline.

=== Keycloak Configuration Overview

To setup Keycloak for use with Optiva's APIs, you must perform the following tasks:


. <<Identifying the Keycloak Admin Account>>

. <<Creating a Keycloak Realm>>

. <<Creating a Keycloak User>>

. <<Creating Keycloak Client Realm Roles for Interacting with the Customer Management Database>>

. <<Creating a Keycloak User Account for Interacting with the Customer Management Database>>

. <<Creating a Client and Users for API Gateway Access>>

.. <<Creating a BSS User Account for an API Gateway>>

.. <<Creating Keycloak Client Scopes for API Gateway>>

.. <<Creating Keycloak Client for API Gateway>>

.. <<Creating a Keycloak User Account for an API Gateway>>


== Configuring Keycloak for User Authentication

=== Identifying the Keycloak Admin Account

During Keycloak installation an administrator account was created and this account is used as a super admin with full permissions to manage Keycloak. You can log into the Keycloak Admin Console to create realms, clients and users with an administrator account.

The credentials for the admin account are detailed in the _keycloak/values-cms.${env}.yaml_ 
file used during the installation.

For more information on an admin account see https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#creating-first-admin_server_administration_guide[the official Keycloak documentation].

=== Creating a Keycloak Realm

A Keycloak realm is where objects such as users, applications, roles, and groups are managed. The API User will be assigned to and is able to log into a realm.

==== Prerequisite
* You will need the login credentials for the Keycloak administrator account created during deployment. For more information on an admin account https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#creating-first-admin_server_administration_guide[follow this link to the Keycloak documentation].

==== Procedure
For steps to create a new realm, https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#configuring-realms[follow this link to the official procdure on the Keycloak website].

=== Creating a Keycloak User

A Keycloak User represents a person that can access applications using Keycloak. A User will have personal associated attributes, for example email and home address. Users can be assigned group membership and can have specific roles assigned to them.

A User is created within the Customer Management realm and is granted access to multiple applications using Keycloak clients.

==== Prerequisite
* You must know the login credentials for the Keycloak administrator account created during deployment. For more information on an admin account https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#creating-first-admin_server_administration_guide[follow this link to the Keycloak documentation].

* You must have created the Customer Management realm as described in <<Creating a Keycloak Realm>>.

==== Procedure

For steps to create a new User, follow the procedure in https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#proc-creating-user_server_administration_guide[the official Keycloak documentation].

=== Creating Keycloak Client Realm Roles for Interacting with the Customer Management Database

Keycloak roles provide a type or a category for a User such as admin, user, manager, and employee. All are typical roles that may exist in an organization.

The following configuration creates the required realm roles for interacting with the Customer Management Database.

==== Prerequisite

* You must be logged into the Keycloak UI using the admin login credentials.

==== Configuration

== Request Sequencing for Complex Workflows

Paragraph to cover how requests can acheive single goals or be stitched together into a more complex user journeys.

=== Provisioning a New Subscriber

To have an active Subscription, subscribers must be associated with an Account, which in turn must be associated with a Customer and a Party. To add a new Subscription to an Account, use the _productOrder_ endpoint.

There are two methods to provision a new subscriber if an Account entity, a Customer entity, and a Party entity are also needed: 

* Using the _quickPrepaidBillingAccount_ endpoint. When using this endpoint, Customer Management creates a corresponding Party and Customer for the new Account. You can then create a new Subscription for the newly created Account

* Creating each entity using the following endpoints, and then creating a new Subscription for the newly created Account:

** _individual_

** _customer_

** _billingAccount_

=== Managing Payment Methods

Payment methods provide the mechanism to retrieve Account payment information, debit card or credit card details, from an external payment gateway to ensure your system is compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).

Customer Management stores the authentication credentials to retrieve payment method details for individual Accounts. None of the sensitive payment method details are stored in Customer Management.

*Note:* An Account can have only one stored payment method at any time.
