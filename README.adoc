== Overview
Optiva's OBP API gateway enables integrators to leverage the power of OBP with third-party applications.

OBP's API gateway consists of the three following API Specifications:

* *cmsapigw-swagger -* Customer Management API, which includes a series of requests that allow third-party applications to manage the life cycle of a telecomms subscriber. 

* *obp-rtr-apigw -* OBP API (REST to REST), which includes a series of requests to interact with OBP.   

* *obp-rts-apigw -* OBP API (REST to SOAP), which includes a series of requests to interact with OBP. 

OBP's API leverages endpoints that are goal-oriented and that can be used either individually or as part of a more complex workflow.

[NOTE]
====
OBP's API specifications are holistic and include both requests that can be integrated against by third parties as well as requests that are only for Optiva's use.
====

=== TMF Certified Endpoints

OBP's API gateway has been created leveraging TMF specifications for requests and responses. The following endpoints are TMF certified:

==== Customer Management API

== Getting Started

OBP's API gateway uses Keycloak for authentication of requests.

=== Introduction to Keycloak

https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] is used to provide the identity management module for secure access between external applications and OBP.

Keycloak provides Single Sign-On (SSO) capability, Identity Brokering, User Federation, and Authorization Services. Keycloak supports external identity providers (IDPs) such as LDAP or ADP via User Federation and SSO redirect for OIDC & SAML logins via Identity Brokering.

[NOTE]
====
To acquire Keycloak access to enable integration against OBP's API gateway, contact the Optiva Services team.

====

== Request Sequencing for Common Use Cases

Optivaâ€™s API provides integrators with a single interface to tailor the OBP subscriber life-cycle functionality to their application workflows.The OBP functionality is exposed to the integrator as a set of RESTfull endpoints. The following section describes the endpoints that are used to achieve the common workflows of third-party digital channels.  

=== Provisioning a New Subscriber

The following section describes the endpoints, request types and sequence that should be used to provision a new subscriber using OBP's API.

==== Considerations

To have an active Subscription, subscribers must be associated with an Account, which in turn must be associated with a Customer and a Party. To add a new Subscription to an Account, use the _productOrder_ endpoint.

There are two methods to provision a new subscriber if an Account entity, a Customer entity, and a Party entity are also needed: 

* Using the _quickPrepaidBillingAccount_ endpoint. When using this endpoint, Customer Management creates a corresponding Party and Customer for the new Account. You can then create a new Subscription for the newly created Account.

* Creating each entity using the following endpoints, and then creating a new Subscription for the newly created Account:

** _individual_

** _customer_

** _billingAccount_

Customer Management stores the authentication credentials to retrieve payment method details for individual Accounts. None of the sensitive payment method details are stored in Customer Management.

[NOTE]
====
An Account can have only one stored payment method at any time.

=== Using Refer a Friend Bonuses

The following section describes the endpoints, request types and sequence that should be used to manage Refer a Friend bonuses using OBP's API.

Refer a Friend (RAF) functionality provides the mechanism to offer bonuses and add ons. This includes the ability to do the following:

* Retrieve a Customer's RAF code

* View a Customer's RAF history

* Validate an RAF code

* Apply RAF bonuses and add ons to new or active subscriptions

When using RAF functionality, both the referring customer (referrer) and the referred customer can be eligible to receive bonuses and add ons.

[NOTE]
====
Bonuses and add ons can include monetary rewards for both the referrer and referred customer as well as product offerings that can be added to a subscription.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
RAF functionality is not available on all deployments of OBP, for more information about RAF contact the Optiva Services team.
