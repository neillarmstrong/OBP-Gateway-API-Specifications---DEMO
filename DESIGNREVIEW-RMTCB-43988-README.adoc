== Overview
Optiva's API gateway enables integrators to leverage the power of Optiva's BSS and Customer Management solution with third-party applications.

We have three specifications:

* Customer Management API

* Rest to Rest 

* Rest to Soap

Some explanation as to why that is

Optiva's API leverages endpoints that are goal-oriented and that can be used either individually or as part of a more complex workflow.

Optiva's API uses Keycloak for authentication.

*Note:* Optiva's API specifications are hollistic and include both requests that can be integrated against by third parties as well as requests that are only for Optiva's use.

== Getting Started

Optiva's API gateway uses Keycloak for authentication of requests.
